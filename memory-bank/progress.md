# Progress Log

## 2025-06-06: Auth Navigation Fixes

### Implemented Changes

- **Fixed Auth Navigation Freezing**: Resolved the issue where the app would freeze when rapidly navigating between sign-in and sign-up screens by implementing:

  - Navigation state tracking in auth layout to prevent rapid screen transitions
  - Navigation counters to detect and mitigate excessive navigation attempts
  - Debounced navigation links with disabled states when already navigating
  - Proper timeout management to prevent navigation conflicts

- **Improved Onboarding Layout Error Handling**:

  - Added more detailed error messages for authentication failures
  - Implemented proper redirect state tracking to prevent multiple redirects
  - Enhanced loading states with clearer user feedback during transitions
  - Added cleanup of timeouts to prevent memory leaks

- **Enhanced Authentication Flows**:
  - Added protection against multiple simultaneous navigation attempts
  - Implemented proper animation durations and timing
  - Added visual feedback when navigation links are temporarily disabled

### Next Steps

1. Continue implementation of voice cloning with ElevenLabs API
2. Add user-friendly error messages in the onboarding process
3. Test the complete authentication and onboarding flow for stability

## 2025-06-05: Onboarding Flow & Voice Cloning Fixes

### Implemented Changes

- **Improved Editorial Profile Generation**: Updated the AI model to GPT-4o and enhanced the prompt in the process-onboarding Supabase function for more detailed, actionable editorial profiles.

- **Voice Cloning Integration Enhancement**: Added better error handling and logging for the ElevenLabs voice cloning integration in the process-onboarding function, including explicit status tracking and error reporting.

- **Onboarding Navigation Fixes**: Implemented proper authentication checks in the onboarding layout to prevent navigation errors after completion. Added graceful redirection to sign-in when authentication issues are detected.

- **Sign-Up Stability Improvements**: Fixed UI freezing in the sign-up screen by adding input validation, improving error handling, and adding a delay before navigation to prevent UI thread blocking.

- **Task Tracking**: Created a new task (ONB-002) to track remaining issues with onboarding flow and voice cloning integration, with a clear implementation plan.

### Next Steps

1. Fix voice clone status updates in the database to ensure proper tracking of cloning requests
2. Implement user-friendly error messages throughout the onboarding flow
3. Add retry mechanisms for failed operations during voice sample processing
4. Test the complete onboarding flow from sign-up through voice recording to editorial profile generation

## June 2, 2023

### Environment Variable Access Pattern Fixed

- Updated environment variable access pattern in `lib/config/env.ts` to use dot notation instead of bracket notation
- This change was necessary to comply with Expo's static analysis requirements for environment variables
- Before: `const value = process.env[key]` (not compatible with Expo's static analysis)
- After: Using explicit dot notation like `process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- This change ensures that Expo can properly inline the environment variables during build time
- Also updated the audit findings document to reflect the proper approach
- The change will help prevent environment variable-related issues in production builds
