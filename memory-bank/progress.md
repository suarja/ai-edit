# Project Progress: AI Edit

## Current Development Focus

We are preparing the app for TestFlight beta testing, implementing usage tracking to limit video generation without payments, and finalizing the onboarding flow to ensure a smooth user experience. The focus is on creating a robust beta version that allows for thorough testing of core functionality.

8. Prepare app metadata for TestFlight submission

## Blockers & Dependencies

1. ~~RevenueCat API key setup required~~ No longer needed for initial release
2. ~~Need to confirm subscription pricing tiers~~ Deferred
3. ElevenLabs integration requires testing with new flow
4. Need to establish appropriate usage limits for TestFlight users
