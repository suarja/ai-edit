# Task: Enhanced Onboarding Flow Implementation

## Task ID: ONB-001

## Complexity Level: Level 3

## Priority: High

## Description

Enhance the onboarding flow based on the template found in `docs/onboarding/video-transcription.md`. The goal is to create a more engaging and effective onboarding experience that improves user retention and conversion, while maintaining the existing voice recording/upload functionality for voice cloning and editorial profile generation.

## Requirements

1. Implement a multi-step onboarding flow based on the template
2. Maintain the existing voice recording/upload functionality
3. Use the recorded/uploaded audio for voice cloning
4. Use LLM analysis to generate the editorial profile from the audio
5. Add a proper monetization path with free trial options
6. Implement progress tracking throughout the flow
7. Add a survey component to capture user pain points and needs
8. Add proper transitions and animations between steps
9. Follow TDD approach for implementation

## Affected Components

- `app/(onboarding)/welcome.tsx`
- `app/(onboarding)/editorial.tsx`
- `app/(onboarding)/voice-clone.tsx`
- `supabase/functions/process-onboarding/index.ts`
- New components to be created

## Success Criteria

- User can complete the onboarding flow with voice recording/upload
- Editorial profile is automatically generated from the audio
- Voice clone is created from the audio
- Conversion rate to paid users is tracked
- All tests pass

## Test Plan

We will follow a TDD approach with the following test layers:

1. Unit tests for individual components
2. Integration tests for the onboarding flow
3. End-to-end tests for the complete user journey
