# Task: Improve Prompt Enhancement Feature

## Task ID: PE-001

## Complexity Level: Level 3

## Priority: High

## Description

Improve the prompt enhancement feature to better align with video generation requirements and fix UI state management issues. The current implementation produces prompts that are too long for video generation context and has input field update issues after enhancement.

## Current Issues

1. ✅ **Prompt Quality Issues**: Enhanced prompts are too long and not optimized for short-form video content (should be 30-60 seconds, ~60-120 words)
2. ✅ **UI State Management**: After enhancement, the input field becomes unresponsive and can't be edited
3. ✅ **Testing Issues**: Test failures due to React Native dependencies in web environment
4. ✅ **Missing Reset Functionality**: No way to reset the form to its initial state
5. ✅ **Generic Enhancement**: Not tailored for video generation pipeline
6. ✅ **System Prompt Validation**: Validation failed error due to length limit mismatch (1000 vs 2000 characters)

## Requirements Analysis

## Additional Issue Resolved: Missing Video Titles and Descriptions

### Problem Identified ✅

In the generated videos pages (`app/(tabs)/videos.tsx` and `app/(tabs)/videos/[id].tsx`), videos were displaying as "Vidéo sans titre" (Untitled Video) with no description because:

1. **Missing Data**: The `video_requests` table only stored `script_id`, `render_status`, `render_url`, etc., but no `title` or `description` fields
2. **UI Expectations**: Components like `VideoCard.tsx` and `GeneratedVideoCard.tsx` expected `title` and `description` properties that weren't available
3. **Data Relationship**: The connection between video requests and scripts wasn't being utilized to show meaningful information

### Solution Implemented ✅

**Approach Chosen**: Modify UI to use existing data (rather than complex pipeline refactoring)

#### Key Changes:

1. **Enhanced Data Fetching**: Modified video fetching to include script information using Supabase joins:

   ```sql
   script:scripts!inner(
     id,
     raw_prompt,
     generated_script,
     output_language
   )
   ```

2. **Data Transformation**: Created `transformVideoForDisplay()` function that:

   - Uses `script.raw_prompt` as the video title (truncated to 50 chars)
   - Creates description from status + language info
   - Generates tags from output language

3. **Updated Components**:
   - **`app/(tabs)/videos.tsx`**: Now fetches and displays script-based titles and descriptions
   - **`app/(tabs)/videos/[id].tsx`**: Enhanced with script information and French localization
   - **`components/GeneratedVideoCard.tsx`**: Updated to handle both old and new data formats

#### Video Display Results:

- **Title**: Shows actual user prompt (e.g., "Créer une vidéo sur les conseils de productivité...")
- **Description**: Shows status + language (e.g., "Prêt • FR", "En cours de génération • EN")
- **Processing View**: Shows prompt preview during video generation
- **Localization**: Full French text throughout the interface

#### Data Structure:

```typescript
// Before: Limited data
{
  id, script_id, render_status, render_url, created_at;
}

// After: Rich display data
{
  id,
    title,
    description,
    render_status,
    render_url,
    created_at,
    prompt,
    script_content,
    output_language;
}
```

### Technical Implementation ✅

- **Database Queries**: Enhanced with proper Supabase joins to fetch script data
- **Type Safety**: Added new `DisplayVideo` and `EnhancedGeneratedVideoType` types
- **Backward Compatibility**: `GeneratedVideoCard` supports both old and new data formats
- **Error Handling**: Proper fallbacks for missing script data
- **Performance**: Single query fetches all needed data without N+1 problems

### User Experience Improvements ✅

- Videos now show meaningful titles instead of "Untitled Video"
- Status and language information clearly displayed
- Processing videos show prompt preview for context
- Consistent French localization throughout
- Better visual hierarchy with status-based styling

This solution provides rich video information without requiring complex database schema changes or pipeline modifications. Users can now easily identify their videos and understand their generation status.

## NEW BUG FIX: S3 Video Upload Failing with 400 Error (Level 1)

### Problem Identified 🔍

Video upload is failing at the S3 upload step with a 400 error. The issue occurs after successful presigned URL generation when attempting to upload the video blob to S3.

**Error Pattern**:

```
LOG  Upload error: [Error: S3 upload failed: 400]
```

**Root Cause Analysis**:
The problem is in `components/VideoUploader.tsx` line 130 where `API_HEADERS.SUPABASE_AUTH` is used for the S3 upload:

```typescript
const uploadResponse = await fetch(presignedUrl, {
  method: 'PUT',
  body: blob,
  headers: API_HEADERS.SUPABASE_AUTH, // ❌ PROBLEM
});
```

This causes two issues:

1. **Content-Type mismatch**: Sets `Content-Type: application/json` but uploads `video/quicktime` blob
2. **Unnecessary Authorization**: S3 presigned URLs don't need additional auth headers

### Solution Plan 📋

**Level 1 Fix**: Remove the problematic headers and let the browser set the correct Content-Type automatically.

**Files to modify**:

- `components/VideoUploader.tsx`: Fix S3 upload headers

**Expected outcome**: Video upload should work correctly with proper Content-Type handling for various video formats (.mov, .mp4, etc.)

### Implementation Status ✅

- [x] Fix headers in VideoUploader.tsx - Removed `API_HEADERS.SUPABASE_AUTH` and let browser handle Content-Type
- [x] Code verification completed - Linter shows no errors, only minor unused variable warning
- [x] Fix validated and ready for testing
- [x] Document the fix

### Status: ✅ READY FOR TESTING

**Summary**: The S3 video upload bug has been fixed by removing the problematic headers that were causing Content-Type conflicts. The fix is minimal, targeted, and follows S3 best practices where presigned URLs handle authentication automatically and browsers set appropriate Content-Type headers.

**Next Steps**:

- User should test video upload with the fix applied
- Expected result: Video uploads should now succeed without 400 errors
- Ready to transition to REFLECT mode once testing confirms the fix works

### Technical Fix Applied ✅

**File Modified**: `components/VideoUploader.tsx`

**Change Made**: Removed the problematic `headers: API_HEADERS.SUPABASE_AUTH` from the S3 upload request at line 130.

**Explanation**:

- S3 presigned URLs include all necessary authentication in the URL itself
- Browsers automatically set the correct `Content-Type` header based on the blob type
- The previous headers (`Content-Type: application/json`) conflicted with the actual video content type (`video/quicktime`)

**Code Change**:

```typescript
// Before (problematic)
const uploadResponse = await fetch(presignedUrl, {
  method: 'PUT',
  body: blob,
  headers: API_HEADERS.SUPABASE_AUTH, // ❌ Caused 400 error
});

// After (fixed)
const uploadResponse = await fetch(presignedUrl, {
  method: 'PUT',
  body: blob,
  // No custom headers needed - let browser set correct Content-Type
  // S3 presigned URLs handle authentication automatically
});
```

### Build Verification ✅

**Command Executed**:

```
npm run lint -- components/VideoUploader.tsx
```

**Result**:

```
/Users/swarecito/App/2025/ai-edit/components/VideoUploader.tsx
  28:10  warning  'uploadProgress' is assigned a value but never used  @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars

✖ 1 problem (0 errors, 1 warning)
```

**Analysis**:

- ✅ No TypeScript or syntax errors from our fix
- ⚠️ Minor warning about unused `uploadProgress` variable (pre-existing, not related to our fix)
- ✅ Code change successfully validated by project linter

## Additional Implementation: Video Deletion System & UI Simplification

### Problem Identified ✅

**Video Deletion Issue**: Videos were only deleted from Supabase database, leaving orphaned files in AWS S3 storage, causing storage waste and potential cost issues.

**UI Complexity**: Video details page had both "Copy Link" and "Share" buttons, creating redundancy since iOS share dialog already includes copy option.

### Solution Implemented ✅

#### 1. Complete Video Deletion System

**New Backend Endpoint**: `server-primary/src/routes/api/videoDelete.ts`

```typescript
// Key Features:
- Authenticates user with Clerk
- Fetches video details with ownership verification
- Deletes video from S3 using AWS SDK
- Deletes database record from Supabase
- Handles partial failures gracefully
- Returns detailed success/failure information
```

**API Route Added**: `DELETE /api/videos`

- Added to `server-primary/src/routes/api/index.ts`
- Health check endpoint: `GET /api/video-delete/health`

**Mobile Integration**: Updated `mobile/lib/config/api.ts`

- Added `VIDEO_DELETE()` endpoint
- Works with existing API environment configuration

#### 2. Updated Video Details Screen

**File**: `mobile/app/video-details/[id].tsx`

```typescript
// Changes:
- Uses new video deletion API endpoint
- Removed copyVideoUrl function (no longer needed)
- Enhanced delete confirmation with better error handling
- Added proper authentication token management
```

#### 3. Simplified UI Interface

**Video Action Buttons**: Updated `VideoActionButtons.tsx` usage

- Set `showCopyLink={false}` in video details
- Keeps only essential actions: Download, Share, Edit, Delete
- iOS Share dialog provides copy functionality automatically

### Key Technical Improvements ✅

1. **Complete Resource Cleanup**: Both S3 storage and database records are removed
2. **Security**: User can only delete their own videos (double verification)
3. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of partial failures (S3 vs DB)
4. **Cost Efficiency**: Prevents orphaned S3 files accumulating storage costs
5. **UX Simplification**: Removed redundant copy button, leverages native sharing

### Build Details ✅

**Directory Structure**:

- `/server-primary/src/routes/api/videoDelete.ts`: New deletion endpoint
- `/mobile/lib/config/api.ts`: Updated API configuration
- `/mobile/app/video-details/[id].tsx`: Enhanced deletion handling
- `/mobile/components/VideoActionButtons.tsx`: Simplified UI usage

**API Flow**:

1. Client authenticates with Clerk token
2. Server verifies user and video ownership
3. S3 deletion using AWS SDK
4. Database deletion using Supabase
5. Success response with cleanup details

**Error Handling Strategy**:

- Continue DB deletion even if S3 fails (prevents orphaned records)
- Detailed error logging for troubleshooting
- User-friendly error messages
- Development vs production error reporting

### Testing Considerations ✅

**Manual Testing Required**:

- Upload a video through mobile app
- Verify S3 file exists in AWS console
- Delete video through new endpoint
- Confirm both S3 file and DB record removed

**Edge Cases Handled**:

- Missing storage path (S3 deletion skipped)
- S3 deletion failure (DB deletion continues)
- Authentication failures
- Video ownership verification
- Non-existent video IDs

### Status: ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

**Backend**: ✅ Video deletion endpoint with S3 and DB cleanup
**Frontend**: ✅ Enhanced deletion with better error handling  
**UI**: ✅ Simplified interface removing redundant copy button
**Integration**: ✅ Full API integration with existing auth system

The video deletion system now provides complete resource cleanup while maintaining security and providing a simplified, intuitive user interface.
