# Task: Improve Prompt Enhancement Feature

## Task ID: PE-001

## Complexity Level: Level 3

## Priority: High

## Description

Improve the prompt enhancement feature to better align with video generation requirements and fix UI state management issues. The current implementation produces prompts that are too long for video generation context and has input field update issues after enhancement.

## Current Issues

1. ✅ **Prompt Quality Issues**: Enhanced prompts are too long and not optimized for short-form video content (should be 30-60 seconds, ~60-120 words)
2. ✅ **UI State Management**: After enhancement, the input field becomes unresponsive and can't be edited
3. ✅ **Testing Issues**: Test failures due to React Native dependencies in web environment
4. ✅ **Missing Reset Functionality**: No way to reset the form to its initial state
5. ✅ **Generic Enhancement**: Not tailored for video generation pipeline
6. ✅ **System Prompt Validation**: Validation failed error due to length limit mismatch (1000 vs 2000 characters)

## Requirements Analysis

### Video Pipeline Alignment ✅

**Completed Analysis**:

- **ScriptGenerator**: Expects ~75-150 words (30-60 seconds \* ~2.5 words/second)
- **ScriptReviewer**: Flags if >110-130 words max (60 seconds)
- **Video-Creatomate-Agent-V2**: Expects 60-120 words total for 30-60 second videos
- **Optimal Range**: 60-120 words for the complete video generation pipeline

### UI/UX Requirements ✅

- Vertical controls layout for better space utilization
- Undo/Redo functionality with proper state management
- Reset functionality to clear all form fields
- Word count validation aligned with video pipeline requirements
- Length validation with appropriate error messages

### Technical Requirements ✅

- API validation alignment with UI constraints (2000 character limit for system prompts)
- Proper metadata versioning for prompt bank updates
- Test coverage avoiding React Native dependencies

## Additional Issue Resolved: Missing Video Titles and Descriptions

### Problem Identified ✅

In the generated videos pages (`app/(tabs)/videos.tsx` and `app/(tabs)/videos/[id].tsx`), videos were displaying as "Vidéo sans titre" (Untitled Video) with no description because:

1. **Missing Data**: The `video_requests` table only stored `script_id`, `render_status`, `render_url`, etc., but no `title` or `description` fields
2. **UI Expectations**: Components like `VideoCard.tsx` and `GeneratedVideoCard.tsx` expected `title` and `description` properties that weren't available
3. **Data Relationship**: The connection between video requests and scripts wasn't being utilized to show meaningful information

### Solution Implemented ✅

**Approach Chosen**: Modify UI to use existing data (rather than complex pipeline refactoring)

#### Key Changes:

1. **Enhanced Data Fetching**: Modified video fetching to include script information using Supabase joins:

   ```sql
   script:scripts!inner(
     id,
     raw_prompt,
     generated_script,
     output_language
   )
   ```

2. **Data Transformation**: Created `transformVideoForDisplay()` function that:

   - Uses `script.raw_prompt` as the video title (truncated to 50 chars)
   - Creates description from status + language info
   - Generates tags from output language

3. **Updated Components**:
   - **`app/(tabs)/videos.tsx`**: Now fetches and displays script-based titles and descriptions
   - **`app/(tabs)/videos/[id].tsx`**: Enhanced with script information and French localization
   - **`components/GeneratedVideoCard.tsx`**: Updated to handle both old and new data formats

#### Video Display Results:

- **Title**: Shows actual user prompt (e.g., "Créer une vidéo sur les conseils de productivité...")
- **Description**: Shows status + language (e.g., "Prêt • FR", "En cours de génération • EN")
- **Processing View**: Shows prompt preview during video generation
- **Localization**: Full French text throughout the interface

#### Data Structure:

```typescript
// Before: Limited data
{
  id, script_id, render_status, render_url, created_at;
}

// After: Rich display data
{
  id,
    title,
    description,
    render_status,
    render_url,
    created_at,
    prompt,
    script_content,
    output_language;
}
```

### Technical Implementation ✅

- **Database Queries**: Enhanced with proper Supabase joins to fetch script data
- **Type Safety**: Added new `DisplayVideo` and `EnhancedGeneratedVideoType` types
- **Backward Compatibility**: `GeneratedVideoCard` supports both old and new data formats
- **Error Handling**: Proper fallbacks for missing script data
- **Performance**: Single query fetches all needed data without N+1 problems

### User Experience Improvements ✅

- Videos now show meaningful titles instead of "Untitled Video"
- Status and language information clearly displayed
- Processing videos show prompt preview for context
- Consistent French localization throughout
- Better visual hierarchy with status-based styling

This solution provides rich video information without requiring complex database schema changes or pipeline modifications. Users can now easily identify their videos and understand their generation status.
