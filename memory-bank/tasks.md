# Task: Improve Prompt Enhancement Feature

## Task ID: PE-001

## Complexity Level: Level 3

## Priority: High

## Description

Improve the prompt enhancement feature to better align with video generation requirements and fix UI state management issues. The current implementation produces prompts that are too long for video generation context and has input field update issues after enhancement.

## Current Issues

1. ✅ **Prompt Quality Issues**: Enhanced prompts are too long and not optimized for short-form video content (should be 30-60 seconds, ~60-120 words)
2. ✅ **UI State Management**: After enhancement, the input field becomes unresponsive and can't be edited
3. ✅ **Testing Issues**: Test failures due to React Native dependencies in web environment
4. ✅ **Missing Features**: No reset functionality for clearing the form
5. ✅ **Generic Enhancement**: Prompts are not tailored for video generation context
6. ✅ **NEW**: Word count validation not aligned with video pipeline requirements
7. ✅ **NEW**: System prompt length validation inconsistency (500 vs 1500 maxLength)
8. ✅ **NEW**: UI controls layout needs optimization for better space utilization

## Requirements

1. ✅ **Optimize Enhancement Prompts**: Update prompt-bank.json agents to focus on short-form video content
2. ✅ **Fix UI State Management**: Resolve input field update issues in PromptInput.tsx
3. ✅ **Add Reset Functionality**: Implement form reset button
4. ✅ **Improve Test Coverage**: Fix existing tests and add comprehensive test coverage
5. ✅ **Code Structure**: Improve robustness and align with video generation requirements
6. ✅ **NEW**: Align word count validation with video pipeline (60-120 words optimal)
7. ✅ **NEW**: Fix system prompt length validation and display
8. ✅ **NEW**: Optimize UI layout with vertical control column

## Affected Files

- ✅ `lib/agents/scriptReviewer.ts` - Fixed TypeScript error handling

## Target Video Content Specifications

For short-form video generation, enhanced prompts should be:

- **Length**: 60-120 words maximum (30-60 seconds of video) ✅
- **Structure**: Clear, concise, action-oriented ✅
- **Content**: Optimized for script generation, not visual editing ✅
- **Language**: Specified output language with natural expressions ✅
- **Focus**: Single key message or concept per video ✅
- **Pipeline Alignment**: Compatible with scriptGenerator.ts and scriptReviewer.ts ✅

## Video Pipeline Alignment Analysis

✅ **Completed Analysis**:

- **ScriptGenerator**: Expects ~75-150 words (30-60 seconds \* ~2.5 words/second)
- **ScriptReviewer**: Flags if >110-130 words max (60 seconds)
- **Video-Creatomate-Agent-V2**: Expects 60-120 words total for 30-60 second videos
- **Optimal Range**: 60-120 words for video generation pipeline

## UI State Management Requirements

✅ **All Completed**:

- Input field must remain editable after enhancement
- Proper state synchronization between parent and child components
- Robust handling of async enhancement operations
- Clean history management for undo/redo functionality
- Vertical control layout for better space utilization
