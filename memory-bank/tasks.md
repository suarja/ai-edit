- **Solution**: Added navigation link in "Création de Contenu" section
- **Location**: Between "Profil Éditorial" and before "Compte" section
- **Icon**: Play icon for video configuration
- **Label**: "Configuration Vidéo"

### 4. Created Reusable Storage Utility ✅

- **Enhancement**: Created `CaptionConfigStorage` utility class
- **Features**:
  - Clean API for load/save/clear operations
  - User-scoped storage keys
  - Default configuration provider
  - Comprehensive error handling

## 📁 FILES MODIFIED

### Core Pages ✅

- `app/(tabs)/video-settings.tsx` - Enhanced with database fallback and AsyncStorage support
- `app/(tabs)/settings.tsx` - Added navigation link to video settings

### Database Schema ✅

- `supabase/migrations/create_caption_configurations.sql` - Created table definition (ready for deployment)

### Navigation ✅

- `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` - Video settings route already configured

## 🎯 IMPROVEMENTS ACHIEVED

## 📝 TECHNICAL NOTES

### Database Migration Strategy

The `create_caption_configurations.sql` migration is ready but not applied to avoid database disruption. The app now works with:

1. **With Table**: Full database functionality
2. **Without Table**: AsyncStorage fallback with same UX

### Storage Format

Both database and AsyncStorage use consistent format:

```typescript
{
  presetId: string,
  placement: 'top' | 'middle' | 'bottom',
  lines: 1 | 3
}
```

### Error Handling

- Database errors (42P01) trigger AsyncStorage fallback
- Network errors use AsyncStorage fallback
- User always gets consistent functionality
