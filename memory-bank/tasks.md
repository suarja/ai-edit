# Task: Improve Prompt Enhancement Feature

## Task ID: PE-001

## Complexity Level: Level 3

## Priority: High

## Description

Improve the prompt enhancement feature to better align with video generation requirements and fix UI state management issues. The current implementation produces prompts that are too long for video generation context and has input field update issues after enhancement.

## Current Issues

1. ✅ **Prompt Quality Issues**: Enhanced prompts are too long and not optimized for short-form video content (should be 30-60 seconds, ~60-120 words)
2. ✅ **UI State Management**: After enhancement, the input field becomes unresponsive and can't be edited
3. ✅ **Testing Issues**: Test failures due to React Native dependencies in web environment
4. ✅ **Missing Reset Functionality**: No way to reset the form to its initial state
5. ✅ **Generic Enhancement**: Not tailored for video generation pipeline
6. ✅ **System Prompt Validation**: Validation failed error due to length limit mismatch (1000 vs 2000 characters)

## Requirements Analysis

### Video Pipeline Alignment ✅

**Completed Analysis**:

- **ScriptGenerator**: Expects ~75-150 words (30-60 seconds \* ~2.5 words/second)
- **ScriptReviewer**: Flags if >110-130 words max (60 seconds)
- **Video-Creatomate-Agent-V2**: Expects 60-120 words total for 30-60 second videos
- **Optimal Range**: 60-120 words for the complete video generation pipeline

### UI/UX Requirements ✅

- Vertical controls layout for better space utilization
- Undo/Redo functionality with proper state management
- Reset functionality to clear all form fields
- Word count validation aligned with video pipeline requirements
- Length validation with appropriate error messages

### Technical Requirements ✅

- API validation alignment with UI constraints (2000 character limit for system prompts)
- Proper metadata versioning for prompt bank updates
- Test coverage avoiding React Native dependencies

## Level 3 Implementation Plan ✅

### Phase 1: Planning ✅

- [x] Analyze current issues and video pipeline requirements
- [x] Define optimal word counts and length constraints
- [x] Plan UI improvements and control layout
- [x] Design prompt bank versioning strategy

### Phase 2: Creative Design ✅

- [x] Design vertical controls layout for better UX
- [x] Plan word count validation messages aligned with pipeline
- [x] Design prompt bank metadata with proper versioning
- [x] Plan API validation consistency

### Phase 3: Implementation ✅

**Core Components Updated:**

- [x] **PromptInput.tsx**: Refactored with vertical controls, fixed word count validation (60-120 words optimal), improved state management
- [x] **SystemPromptInput.tsx**: Updated character limit to 2000 and fixed display counter
- [x] **usePromptEnhancement.ts**: Enhanced with proper undo/redo and reset functionality
- [x] **prompt-bank.json**: Updated all video agents (v2.0.0) with pipeline alignment, removed scene/editing references, added proper metadata and history
- [x] **VideoValidationService**: Fixed MAX_SYSTEM_PROMPT_LENGTH from 1000 to 2000 characters to match UI

**Key Improvements:**

- Word count validation now shows optimal for 60-120 words (aligned with video pipeline)
- Vertical control layout: Enhance button, Undo/Redo/Reset in column formation
- Fixed "validation failed" error by aligning system prompt length limits
- Enhanced prompts focus on script content, not visual/editing elements
- Proper prompt bank versioning with changelog and metadata

### Phase 4: Testing ✅

- [x] Updated test suites for new validation requirements
- [x] All tests passing (17/17 prompt-related tests)
- [x] Validation error fixed and confirmed working

## Implementation Details

### Prompt Bank Updates (v2.0.0) ✅

- **prompt-enhancer-agent**: Focused on TikTok-style script generation, 60-120 words target
- **system-prompt-enhancer-agent**: TTS optimization and narrative structure guidance
- **system-prompt-generator-agent**: ElevenLabs compatibility and cultural considerations
- **Removed**: Scene/editing references that don't align with script generation workflow

### UI Improvements ✅

- **Vertical Controls Layout**: Better space utilization with column-based controls
- **Word Count Logic**: Now aligned with video pipeline (60-120 words optimal)
- **Character Limits**: Main prompt 1000 chars, system prompt 2000 chars
- **Validation Messages**: Clear guidance for video content optimization

### API Fixes ✅

- **System Prompt Validation**: Increased MAX_SYSTEM_PROMPT_LENGTH to 2000 characters
- **Response Structure**: Consistent with existing patterns
- **Error Handling**: Improved validation error reporting

## Testing Results ✅

### API Tests: 6/6 Passing ✅

- Prompt enhancement with video optimization
- Error handling for missing fields
- OpenAI API integration
- Proper response formatting

### Quality Validation: 5/5 Passing ✅

- Video pipeline alignment verification
- Word count and content optimization
- Agent prompt content validation
- Language and cultural appropriateness

### Component Tests: All Core Tests Passing ✅

- State management and UI responsiveness
- Undo/redo functionality
- Reset and form clearing
- Validation message display

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED - BUILD PHASE

**Final Outcome**: Successfully addressed all 6 issues including the validation error fix. The prompt enhancement feature is now optimized for the video generation pipeline with proper UI controls, aligned validation, and comprehensive testing coverage.
