## Known Issues and Limitations

1. Limited localization support (French only for now)
2. No offline mode for onboarding process
3. Edge function error handling could be improved further

2. Implement offline mode with local storage
3. Enhance analytics tracking for onboarding steps

## Recent Updates to Onboarding Flow

### Database Schema Fix

- Fixed the onboarding_survey table schema to use UUID for user_id instead of bigint
- Updated code to use direct Supabase client calls for survey data saving
- Removed temporary workarounds and fallback mechanisms
- Documented the fix in memory-bank/onboarding-survey-db-fix.md

### Current Issues

- **Auto-Advancing Screens**: The last pages of the survey flow advance automatically without user control, which creates an awkward user experience
- This needs to be fixed to ensure users have full control over when they advance to the next screen
- Affects primarily the features, trial-offer, and subscription screens

### Next Steps

- Fix the auto-advancing screens issue to improve user control
- Implement RevenueCat for subscription and payment processing
- Complete remaining UI refinements and animations
