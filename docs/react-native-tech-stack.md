00:00:00	starting a new react native project in 2025 you've probably noticed there are dozens of options for every single feature you need to build in this video I'll walk you through all the technology you should know about and use to ship epic react native apps what's up react native friends Simon here from galaxy. Dev you probably heard that 2025 is the time for react native maybe because YouTube recommended a certain video to you and it's true react native is better more performing more stable than ever and the community

00:00:36	and packages around it are fantastic Rec native will also only get better from here making the developer experience even more pleasant however starting a new project is usually still painful as there are so many great packages and you can easily waste a lot of time trying out five different libraries that all don't fit your needs trust me been there done that in the next 15 minutes you'll learn which tools and package to choose for your death setup navigation State Management UI components and essential

00:01:06	utilities and everything else you need to start building if you also want to get practical with building re native apps right now check out my brand new Zero to Hero mission on galaxy. Def this mission is divided into different modules to teach you everything from the basics of Expo to building real world apps and submitting them to the App Stores it's the one course that will help you go from idea to finished app while learning the essentials of react native but for the moment let's dive into our first category first of all

00:01:35	let's talk about the core setup of your react native application there are just a couple of things you should keep in mind and there's pretty much nothing to discuss about them if you're getting started with react native in 2025 you want to use expo Expo is the recommended framework inside of the react native documentation and yes you can use it without a framework however if you're building a new app with react native we recommend using a framework otherwise you're pretty much at the end building

00:02:02	your own framework and I know some people still like the community CLI and some people have some objections against Expo which are not true I've got several videos on that so if you're starting now use Expo yes if you have to work with Legacy projects in your company you might be exposed to the community CLI however even in that case I recommend you should slowly migrate to Expo because every big company I know is also using Expo just like that you should also use typescript I bring this up every year and usually I get emails

00:02:31	about this every year can I use it without typescript yes of course you can but you will only benefit from using typescript and those strange enam Union whatever types you sometimes see on Twitter that's most likely not what you're going to end up using in your application anyway you will just be happy that your compiler or your IDE will tell you oh this is not a string you're returning a number from that function and you sit there well that is true that helped me solve a buck so please just use typescript a bit more

00:02:58	challenging is whether you want to use Expo router for navigation or react navigation these are two well they're kind of the same things under the hood Expo router is actually using react navigation react navigation was there before it still exists to me I prefer Expo router because I really like all the tools that Expo brought in and this setup of using file based routing for your application just feels really good to me actually and I've used this now for like 2 or 3 years I don't know how long this has been out it's coming out

00:03:29	with many cool things like API routes uh we have dumb components we have RC support with Expo router now however this is kind of made for like thinking about Native applications in a more cross-platform way which could also Target web if you're more if you say like I just want to build native applications and want to focus on IOS and Android and I like the concept of screens then maybe using react navigation could be enough for you but with that being said I still recommend exp router for everyone getting started

00:04:01	because it's really an easy way to think about the setup and the layout of your application and one addition to this is a package I discovered last year called react native bottom tabs which gives you the ability to have real native bottom tabs in your application which look a lot more smooth on both Android and iOS so go check that out if you're using a tapped bar and then let's heat to the next category talking about UI and styling is somewhat challenging because every project prefers a different

00:04:29	approach a different UI you have a different favor and in general we have component libraries and we have styling libraries that we should talk about so in the past many people used big component libraries like react native paper or react native elements I don't really see a lot of people using them actually in projects however they still have a lot of downloads so some people are still using them and prefer using them they're not really my cup of tea I usually more like styling Solutions like native wind which brings Tailwind CSS to

00:05:01	react native or the project like uni styled which simply uh has pretty much the same API as the stylesheet in react native but enhances it with a lot of great functionalities and version three of uni Styles is right around the corner and maybe you've also heard about chyn which is like super popular on the web and react native reusables brings this concept to react native in a super interesting way so this is definitely something to keep an eye on and something that can work for some project and then we also have tamagi as sort of

00:05:31	like a crossover because it involves styling it has some components and it also has an optimized compiler last year I recommended tamagi as well and I think it's still going strong it's also used in one framework which Nate announced last year and if you can set up tamagi which is a bit more challenging than most of the other Solutions you are rewarded with a pretty solid and very fast and stable system that works crossplatform across iOS Android and web we I don't really see a clear winner in this category yet it is a lot about

00:06:03	flavors and what fits your style of project personally in my project I currently prefer native wind because I know a lot about Tailwind uh AI generation is pretty good and with Native wind you get all of this with react native and then there are also packages like native wind UI which gives you access to pre-built components using native wind under the hood but I definitely see how many people like uni Styles as it's just like a drop in replacement for stylesheet and um with the C++ bindings internally it's super

00:06:33	crossplatform for your application I would also love to see an implementation of Swift UI components and I think there are a couple of libraries already working on that but so far there's no mainstream library that I would recommend at this point to wrap up UI and styling let's quickly also talk about animations just like before I highly recommend react native reanimated this is probably the best thing you can use to include animations in your application and if you want something that works a bit easier you can also

00:07:00	check out moti from fando Rojo this one's still going strong and it's quite easy to use and actually a super interesting Library as well in most cases your application needs some sort of State Management but we need to distinguish between server State and actual App State and little settings you have in your application and for the first thing the winner is pretty clear if you want uh to manage server State API call anything like that you want to use 10stack Query in your application 10stack is by now actually a tool a suit

00:07:31	of tools and 10 St start and router are coming in very strong on the web as well however 10st query is the perfect choice for managing server State on the App State there's usually a clear winner as well which is tand um I uh think I said this last year as well and it's also if you look at the JavaScript Rising Stars the one Library here at the top far above utai and the other libraries um tand is a bit different it has the concept of like a store and actions that you might have actually seen with Redux

00:08:04	before whereas yoai and some other libraries are more Atomic they have like these atems that you can set and influ beyond that I think in general the recommendation would be to use tan however if you then also talk about local Furs and syncing your State uh something like Legend State could come in very handy I tried Legend State last year and you can actually sync pretty easily even to something like super base uh but beyond that you can also use like sqlite Solutions and then use power sync or other uh libraries and services to

00:08:36	implement local first and sync think about the needs of your application first before you jump into any of the popular state management libraries and maybe for some applications the answer is to Simply use the context API and that's fine as well besides all the packages we should also quickly talk about some Essentials for like the tooling you use and my recommendation is to actually at this point use an AI supported editor I switch from vs code to cursor you've seen me use it in a couple of videos it is great at

00:09:04	generating code across multiple files it works really really great I know there's also by now I think wind serve for the new editor and uh vs code has also some improved stuff with AI going on just make sure you have some AI capabilities and I just recommend cursor besides that for testing I recommend you use Maestro Maestro is really great for UI testing and I used it before it's really easy to set up and just a pleasure to work with and if you're talking about testing you also want to take a look at react native

00:09:35	testing Library uh Steve who was guest on the podcast has also a very great guide I think you can find it here in the repository uh he has many code examples that you can take a look at and how to do this and they even have a pretty good uh yeah a cookbook here on how to use something like acing test and custom render functions and this is really the way to go with testing now beyond that if you want monitoring of your bucks and performance of the application I highly recommend Sentry I use this in my own

00:10:06	apps I've used I worked with Sentry before and I can just recommend them 100% I'm really happy that I'm using Sentry as it's catching all the Bucks and problems of my application in real time now for cicd Solutions I wouldn't spin up my own server anymore just use Expo EAS it's honestly the best thing you can do to your react native project it is so unbelievable easy to use um you just push your code it builds in the cloud it automatically submits your application to IOS and Android if you set up the right pipelines uh you can

00:10:42	use EAS updates there's so much more to it they're making it better uh in December I think they announce workflows which replaces a part of like uh you can see with GitHub actions so honestly if you're looking for a cic CD solution go with Expo and regarding debu I have a separate video um but basically you can now use the react native debugging tools and a bit of Expo um for that so check out the video react native debugging from JavaScript to Native and you will see how it works the only addition I can

00:11:14	make to this is that besides the usual tools you have available in your project anyway you could also check out reactor Tron from infinite red which looks a bit old school Jamon I know you're watching this uh and Jamon will work on this this year but it has some pretty cool functionalities that I also explained in the react native debugging video finally I want to mention some musthave packages I think these packages are just awesome and yeah I know not everyone app needs to have them but I still think if you

00:11:44	kind of need a functionality like that you must use these packages one of them is definitely react native mm KV by Mar Ravi and the team at Mello uh I use this all the time it's the fastest key value storage whenever I need to quickly track a setting I don't want to use use async storage just use mm KV it's so much faster besides that you also want to use a library to manage your forms and react hook form works pretty Flawless with react native you can even include zot for type save forms and I use this

00:12:16	before in the Zero to Hero course as well it is just great speaking of lists I said this a couple of times before I had a video on this just use flesh list don't lose flatlist just go with flesh list it is pretty much the same API but it's a lot faster so not only do we have Legend State we might also have Legend list soon with a pretty epic performance keep an eye on this it's probably not yet production ready but this is something that could come up later in 2025 Additionally you want to use the

00:12:43	Expo image package when you display images this package is really designed for Speed and it has built in memory and caching and a lot of other of cool functionalities so just do yourself a favor and use it another Library I love to use is called zigo This is actually like really Niche thing but it's so amazing the drop- down menus and the context menus like these overlays when you do a force touch on iOS it just looks amazing with zego give it a try the integration is quite easy the documentation here can be a bit

00:13:13	challenging but once you get the hang on how it works it is awesome my go-to recommendation as well for authentication is clerk because if you're serious about authentication it's not just exchanging jwt's and like attaching them to your header if you want a user management platform then Clerk is the way to go uh I've used this in a couple of my videos you can easily include uh social providers you can manage your users there's just no way around clerk if you're really serious about making sure your application is

00:13:42	secure and you can manage the users accordingly if you also want to monetize your application don't go straight for the apis of Apple and Google just use Revenue CAD I use Revenue CAD in my own apps it's just a pleasure to sync your products from Apple and Google to revenue Cad and then integrate their dks with react native it works absolutely Flawless finally I'm coming back to another package from micro saav which is the react native vision camera so uh I haven't used this a lot because most of

00:14:10	my apps don't really use the camera but if you're serious about using camera and you want the best performance go check out react native vision camera it's really the best in town you're going to find for capturing photos videos QR code barcode scanning and everything else it's unbelievable fast wiie that is the Thing Mark knows best about he has also built Nitro modules so he knows about like all the C++ stuff trust that guy and finally because I couldn't fit it into any other category yet I just want

00:14:37	to mention the react native gesture Handler is your best friend if you need to capture gestures whether it's a pen gesture a rotation I think I never used that before or a fling or a long press or anything in between use the react native gesture Handler which is usually already included in your Expo application when you start a new app all right that was actually quite a lot but I I hope this gave you a good idea of the best available packages you can and to some degree should use to build a react native app in 2025 I don't really

00:15:08	expect a huge shift in terms of recommendations besides the UI category which is traditionally hard to predict but overall that's a good signal because it shows we have awesome packages and highly skilled people in the react native Community which makes building performance apps a lot easier and more enjoyable but let me know in the comments if you have another favorite package you recommend that I missed if you also want to build and ship your first react native app in 2025 check out the new Zero to Hero Mission at galaxy.

00:15:37	d/m missions which is by the way included in the monthly membership so you get access to a full react native course at a fraction of the usual cost of these courses plus all the existing courses and community of galaxies if you're still unsure whether react native is the right technology in the first place check out why I think 2025 is the best time to get into react native and I'm pretty sure most of you would agree until next time and Happy coding Simon [Music]
