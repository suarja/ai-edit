## Relationship with Other Documentation

This documentation is part of a three-tier documentation system:

1. **[README.md](../README.md)**: High-level overview of the project, designed for first-time visitors
2. **Documentation (here)**: Detailed technical information for developers working on the project
3. **[Memory Bank](../memory-bank/)**: In-depth implementation details, decisions, and technical notes

### When to Use Each Type of Documentation

- Use the **README** for quick orientation and high-level understanding
- Use the **Documentation** for implementation guidance and technical details
- Use the **Memory Bank** for deep dives into specific features and decision records
